# 18-Week Software Engineering Program Guide

This document outlines how to extend a 15-week Software Engineering Program into an 18-week course. The extension allows for a more relaxed pace, providing additional time for mastering complex topics and completing a capstone project. Below is a summary of key technologies and concepts, followed by the weekly course structure.

## Technology Summaries

### HTML & CSS
- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: The standard markup language used to create web pages.
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: Style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML.

### JavaScript & Advanced JavaScript
- **JavaScript**: A programming language that enables interactive web pages. It's a part of most web browsers and allows for client-side script to interact with users, control the browser, and alter document content.
- **Advanced JavaScript**: Covers more complex aspects, including closures, prototypes, asynchronous programming, and ES6+ features.

### DOM (Document Object Model)
- **DOM**: A programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.

### TypeScript
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

### Version Control with Git
- **Git**: A distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.

### Project Management
- **Agile & Scrum**: Agile software development refers to software development methodologies centered around the idea of iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration.

### NodeJS & Express
- **Node.js**: An open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

### MongoDB
- **MongoDB**: A source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.

### React & Redux
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps, often used with React.

### MERN Stack
- **MERN Stack**: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js - a popular stack for building full-stack applications.
