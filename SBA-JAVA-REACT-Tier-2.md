**Tier 2 Java Instructor Assessment: E-Commerce Application using Java Spring Boot, React, and SQL Database**

**Objective**: Develop a fully functional E-Commerce application using Java Spring Boot for the backend, React for the frontend, and a SQL database for data storage. The application should include user authentication, product comments, and deployment using a cloud provider. The final project must be submitted through GitHub.

**Requirements**:

1. **User Authentication**: Implement a secure user authentication system that allows users to sign up, log in, and log out. The system should store user data securely in the SQL database and utilize JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management.

2. **Product Catalog**: Create a product catalog that displays a list of products with their names, images, descriptions, and prices. Users should be able to search and filter products based on categories or keywords.

3. **Product Details**: Develop a product details page that displays more in-depth information about a product when clicked on. The page should include the product's name, image, description, price, and availability.

4. **Comments on Products**: Enable authenticated users to leave comments or reviews on individual products. Comments should be stored in the SQL database and displayed on the product details page.

5. **Shopping Cart**: Implement a shopping cart feature that allows users to add, remove, or modify items in their cart. The cart should store product information and calculate the total cost of the items.

6. **Checkout**: Create a secure checkout process where users can enter their shipping and payment information to complete the purchase.

7. **Admin Panel**: Develop an admin panel for managing products, categories, and user accounts. The panel should be accessible only to authorized administrators.

8. **GitHub Submission**: Submit your project using a GitHub repository, including all source code, assets, and documentation.

9. **Deployment**: Deploy the final E-Commerce application using a cloud provider such as AWS, Google Cloud Platform, or Heroku. Provide a live URL to the deployed application for evaluation.

Please ensure that your submission adheres to best practices for coding, security, and performance.
