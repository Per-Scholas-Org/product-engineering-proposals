## Blockchain Demo: Per Scholas for Ed

**Introduction (Explanation - 5 minutes)**

Good morning everyone, 

Today, we will delve into a technological innovation that's been rapidly gaining traction across industries worldwide: Blockchain technology. 

This digital technology is being embraced by organizations in numerous sectors, from finance to healthcare. Its unique properties have the potential to revolutionize the way we securely store, manage, and exchange data. As a community dedicated to technological prowess and providing cutting-edge technical education, it is imperative that we at Per Scholas understand blockchain technology and its implications.

At its core, a blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger of transactions that is secured using cryptography. The data in the blockchain is organized into 'blocks,' and every block is connected to the one before and after it, forming a 'chain'. What makes blockchain special is its resilience to data modification - once information is in the blockchain, it is extremely difficult to change or hack it.

**Part 1: Blockchain and Business (Demonstration - 10 minutes)**

Blockchain technology can foster secure digital identities and create tamper-resistant records. This quality makes it particularly useful for institutions dealing with sensitive information like medical records or financial transactions. Furthermore, it can significantly reduce costs related to paperwork processing and increase efficiency.

Moreover, the transparency associated with blockchain technology is an essential attribute. All transactions recorded on the blockchain network are visible to all participants, leading to enhanced transparency and trust amongst stakeholders. For example, in supply chain management, blockchain allows every party involved to track the product's journey, instilling trust and accountability. 

We will now walk you through some real-world proposed examples of how businesses can start utilizing blockchain technology to improve their operations and customer experiences.

**1. De Beers: Provenance Tracking** https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/10/30/russian-diamond-giant-signs-onto-de-beers-blockchain-tracking-platform/

De Beers, one of the largest diamond producers in the world, has adopted blockchain technology to improve transparency and provide proof of provenance for its gems. They've developed a blockchain platform named Tracr, which is used to track the journey of a diamond from the mine to the customer. By recording each step in a diamond’s path, they're able to provide a level of transparency that was previously unavailable in the diamond industry. This ensures customers that their diamond has been ethically sourced and that it is of the quality that De Beers claims it to be.

**2. IBM: Food Safety** https://www.ibm.com/products/supply-chain-intelligence-suite/food-trust

IBM developed the Food Trust blockchain to enhance visibility and accountability in the food supply chain. This technology enables participating businesses to trace the supply chain journey of food products, providing consumers with more information about where their food comes from, and helping retailers and suppliers identify and address issues in the supply chain more quickly. For example, Walmart has utilized IBM’s blockchain to trace the source of food products, helping to manage and prevent food safety incidents.

**3. Maersk: Supply Chain Management** https://merehead.com/blog/maersk-blockchain-use-case/

Maersk, the world's largest shipping company, partnered with IBM to create TradeLens, a blockchain-based platform for global trade. TradeLens provides a shared view of shipping transactions, creating a transparent and secure record of transactions. It allows all participants in the supply chain, including shippers, shipping lines, ports, and customs authorities, to interact and share information more effectively. This leads to reduced costs, improved efficiency, and less room for error or fraud.

These examples illustrate the varied and powerful ways that blockchain technology can be used to improve business operations across different industries.

**Part 2: The Role of Blockchain at Per Scholas (Imitation - 10 minutes)**

Understanding and engaging with blockchain technology now prepares us to leverage the opportunities that this promising tool provides. As we strive to stay at the forefront of technological education, we must consider integrating lessons on blockchain technology into our curriculum. 

By doing so, we not only equip our learners with knowledge of a rapidly developing field but also strengthen our reputation as a modern, forward-thinking institution. Additionally, our internal processes, such as maintaining student records or tracking coursework progress, could benefit from the enhanced security and transparency that blockchain technology offers.

Let's consider how we can integrate blockchain technology into our daily operations and educational programs at Per Scholas.

**Conclusion and Hands-on Exercise (Practice - 5 minutes)**

In conclusion, blockchain technology has emerged as a significant force in various sectors and is fast becoming an integral part of future business operations. By embracing blockchain technology, Per Scholas can ensure that we are prepared to utilize this potent tool when required.

Now, to conclude our session, we have an interactive exercise for you. Using a simple online blockchain simulator, let's create our own digital transactions and see how they get added to the blockchain. This hands-on exercise will help us better understand the inner workings of blockchain technology.

Thank you for your time and attention today! As always, we encourage you to continue exploring and learning about blockchain and its vast potential.

**Practice: Creating a MetaMask Wallet (10 minutes)**

MetaMask is a cryptocurrency wallet which you can use directly on your browser. It's also a gateway to blockchain apps.

1. First, you need to install the MetaMask extension on your browser. Go to the MetaMask website and click on "Download."
2. Choose the appropriate browser and proceed to install the extension.
3. Once installed, click on the MetaMask icon in your browser extension tray. Agree to the terms and conditions and click "Create a Wallet."
4. Set a strong password for your wallet. Make sure to remember this password as it'll be needed to access your wallet.
5. MetaMask will now show you your secret recovery phrase. This is a 12-word phrase that can be used to recover your wallet if you forget your password. Save this phrase somewhere safe and offline.
6. Once you have securely saved your recovery phrase, click "Next" and confirm your secret phrase by selecting the words in the correct order.
7. Congratulations, you've just set up your MetaMask Wallet! Now, you can use it to interact with decentralized applications like AAVE and OpenSea.

AAVE is a decentralized finance protocol that allows people to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, OpenSea is a marketplace for the decentralized web, including crypto assets like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and domain names.

**Demonstration: AAVE and OpenSea (15 minutes)**

*Demonstration of AAVE:*
1. Visit the AAVE website and click on "Enter app."
2. Connect your wallet (MetaMask, for example) to the app. You'll be prompted to sign a message to authenticate.
3. On the main interface, you'll see a list of available cryptocurrencies to lend or borrow. You can click on a cryptocurrency to see more details, such as the deposit APY, borrow APR, etc.
4. To lend, you just need to click "Deposit" on your chosen cryptocurrency, input the amount you want to lend, and confirm the transaction.
5. To borrow, click "Borrow," choose your cryptocurrency, input the amount, and confirm the transaction. Make sure you have enough collateral to secure the loan.

*Demonstration of OpenSea:*
1. Visit the OpenSea website and click on "Browse."
2. Here you can explore numerous categories of NFTs like Art, Domain Names, Virtual Worlds, Trading Cards, etc.
3. If you find an NFT that you're interested in, click on it for more details. You can see its price, ownership history, and more.
4. To purchase an NFT, you just need to click "Buy Now," confirm the price, and complete the transaction with your connected wallet.

By the end of this exercise, you should have a good understanding of how to navigate AAVE and OpenSea, as well as how to set up your own MetaMask wallet.
