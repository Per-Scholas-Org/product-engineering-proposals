# Project Charter: Dokku for PerScholas

## Scope

The scope of this project is to create a hosted solution for PerScholas learners in Software Engineering cohorts, allowing them to deploy their projects during class without incurring any cost. This solution will be powered by Dokku and will be hosted on DigitalOcean, supporting thousands of small project websites with expected traffic.

## Objective

The main objective is to provide a cost-effective, scalable, and reliable deployment platform for PerScholas learners' projects, ensuring they can showcase their work without financial constraints.

## Timeline

The project will be completed within 3 months, including research, setup, testing, and implementation.

1. Research and evaluation: 2 weeks
2. Setup and configuration: 4 weeks
3. Testing and optimization: 4 weeks
4. Implementation and deployment: 2 weeks

## Cost

1. Dokku license: $849 (one-time fee)
2. DigitalOcean hosting: $1,000 per month (estimated)

Total initial cost: $1,849

## What will this grant us? How much can it scale? How many cohorts can it support a year?

This project will provide PerScholas with a self-hosted solution that can support multiple cohorts per year. It can scale to thousands of small project websites, allowing us to cater to the needs of every learner in our Software Engineering cohorts.

## Can it be recycled?

Yes, the infrastructure can be reused for future cohorts, ensuring that the initial investment continues to provide value over time.

## What is the policy for recycling? How long are we hosting for?

The recycling policy involves archiving or removing projects from previous cohorts as needed to accommodate new projects. Hosting will be maintained as long as PerScholas continues to provide Software Engineering programs, ensuring that the investment in Dokku and DigitalOcean remains valuable.

## Risks

1. Difficulty in setting up and configuring Dokku for our specific needs.
2. Potential security vulnerabilities in the deployment platform, requiring regular updates and maintenance.
3. Unforeseen costs, such as increased hosting fees due to higher-than-expected traffic or the need for additional server resources.
4. Potential issues with the stability or performance of deployed projects, affecting the learner experience and project showcase quality.

To mitigate these risks, we will:

1. Allocate sufficient time and resources for research, setup, and testing.
2. Implement security best practices and keep the platform updated.
3. Monitor costs and optimize hosting resources to stay within budget.
4. Regularly review and optimize the performance and stability of the deployment platform.
